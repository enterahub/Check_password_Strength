"""
Objective:
Create a Python tool that checks the strength of a password based on various criteria.

**Requirements:
1. Length Check: The password must be at least 12 characters long.
2. Character Diversity: The password should include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and at least two special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $).
3. Common Password Check: The tool should compare the password against a list of the 1000 most common passwords and flag if the password is too common. You will need to create or find a list of common passwords to use for this check.

Output:
- Provide a detailed report on which criteria the password met and which it did not.
- Overall strength rating (e.g., Weak, Moderate, Strong) based on the number of criteria met.

This project will help you practice handling strings, using regular expressions, reading from files, and applying logical checksâ€”skills that are very useful in many areas of software development, including cybersecurity.
